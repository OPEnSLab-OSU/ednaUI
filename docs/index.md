## Initial steps

The first thing to do with the UI is set the RTC of the sampler, which can be found under utilities. This should be done anytime there is a timezone change as well.

Remember that to get updates on status and sensor data to be on the monitoring tab. The top right corner keeps track of the last status update, as well as whether the battery is running low or not.

We have a<a herf="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLI7V_o5-ajbo-sCwobR70pfw0TaJPEW"> youtube playlist </a>for hardware documentation that is useful for the user. This includes documentation for things like removing the SD card, replacing tubing, and removing the battery.

We also have<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149ZBGu_K0_FZGF2qyQsjEpgiQDiWyY6b?usp=sharing"> videos </a>that go over both the UI and how to do Firmware updates.
