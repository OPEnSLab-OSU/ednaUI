## Setting Tasks

Tasks are set and scheduled in the tasks tab. A task that is scheduled for the future is an active task, and a task that has ran is an inactive task.

A new task can be created with the add task button, or if you want to rerun a task you can schedule an inactive task (If changes are made you'll have to save the task first).

Remember that after a task runs that the assigned valves become greyed-out. Under the utilities tab, use "reset valves" if you want to use a valve again.

If you want to make changes to a scheduled task, you have to unschedule it first.

### Recommended Settings For a Task

| Setting Name         | Recommended Setting |
|:---------------------|:--------------------|
| Time Between Valves  | 10 seconds          |
| Flush Time           | 60 seconds          |
| Sample Time & Volume | Varies*             |
| Sample Pressure      | 25 psi              |
| Dry Time             | 15 seconds          |
| Preserve Time        | 15 seconds          |

*The motor intakes about 350ml/min, so set the sample time and sample volume accordingly. If the time is too low, the sampling will stop before it reaches the volume.
