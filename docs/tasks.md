## Setting Tasks

Tasks are set and scheduled in the tasks tab. A task that is scheduled for the future is an active task, and a task that has ran is an inactive task.

Remember that after a task runs that the assigned valves become greyed-out. Under the utilities tab, use "reset valves" if you want to use a valve again.

### Recommended Settings For a Task

Keep the time between for valves to 10 seconds. 
Flush time should be 60 seconds.
The motor intakes about 350ml/min, so set the sample time and sample volume accordingly. If the time is too low, the sampling will stop before it reaches the volume. 
Pressure should be 25 psi.
Dry time should be 15 seconds.
Preserve time should be 15 seconds.
